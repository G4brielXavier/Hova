# Hova – Official Roadmap

This roadmap is not a promise.
It is direction, vision, purpose.
If something changes, it is because the language has grown.

---

## 🎯 HOVA VISION
Hova exists to be:
- simple
- descriptive
- human
- predictable
- useful for those who create worlds and structures
Not to become a confusing, heavy, or overly academic language.

---

# 🟢 Current Phase – Foundation
Goal: make Hova solid, reliable, and stable.

- Defined base syntax
- Stable parser
- Working emitter
- Clear specification
- Basic official documentation
- Official example (Configs, Games ...)
- Functional CLI
- First “serious” release

---

# 🟡 Next Phase – User Comfort
Goal: Make Hova pleasant to use

- Better error messages
- Stronger validation
- Clearer feedback
- Better file organization
- Better UX in the CLI
- Possible IDE / Highlight support
- Official “Hova Best Practices” guide

---

# 🔵 Possible Future Phase
These things are NOT guaranteed.
They will be included if they make sense for Hova's vision:

- Plugins
- Optional extensions
- Visual tools
- Integrations with engines / tools
- Advanced features if necessary
- Commercial tools (if the language grows to the point)

---

# 🧠 Philosophy that guides all decisions
- If it complicates things → it probably won't be included
- If it doesn't solve anything real → it won't be included
- If it takes away from Hova's identity → it won't be included
- If it truly improves the user experience → it will be included
- The community can make suggestions
- The author decides

# 🤝 How to influence the roadmap?
Argue your case.
Show real cases.
Opens issue.
PRs are welcome, but the language vision remains centralized.
