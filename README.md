Stop describing your game worlds in boring JSON or YAML.

**Hova is a human-friendly DSL made for world-building**, entity definition, modding ecosystems, NPC sets, configuration-heavy systems and narrative universes.
Write structured worlds once → export instantly to **JSON, YAML or TOML**.

---

## 🎮 What is Hova?

Hova is a **Domain-Specific Language for creating universes**.

It was designed for:

* games and engines
* RPG & world-building projects
* modding frameworks
* structured narrative systems
* projects with many entities and metadata

Instead of fighting complex JSON trees or repetitive YAML, you describe your world in a clean, expressive syntax.
Then Hova converts it to machine formats.

## 🌌 Why Hova Exists

Hova was created by **Gabriel Xavier (dotxavierket)** to solve a real problem:

Developers, modders, writers and engine creators repeat data structures too much.
They fight ugly configuration formats.
They lose clarity.

Hova exists to:

* make entity definition readable
* formalize worlds without pain
* keep creativity without chaos
* export clean data that engines love

---

## 👤 Who is Hova for?

If your world has entities, rules, metadata or structure, Hova is for you:

✔ Game devs
✔ Indie studios
✔ Modders
✔ Narrative designers
✔ Engine creators
✔ Tool builders

## 🤔 Why not just JSON?

This is the question everyone asks.
And it's the wrong one.

JSON is an excellent machine format.
It is stable, universal and easy to parse.

But JSON was never **designed for human authorship at scale**.

The real problem with JSON

JSON works great when:
- generated by tools
- used as output
- consumed by engines

JSON breaks down when:
- written by hand
- maintained for months of years
- used to describe large worlds
- edited by designers or writers

In game development, world data grows fast:
enemies, items, NPCs, factions, rules, metadata.

JSON does not communicate intent.
it only stores structure.

**Hova's position**

Hova does **not replace JSON.**

Hova exists **before JSON**.

- Hova is the **source of truth**
- JSON / YAML / TOML are **build artifacts**

Just like:
- TypeScript -> JavaScript
- SCSS -> CSS
- Shaders -> bytecode

You don't write bytecode. <br>
You don't write AST. <br>
And you shouldn't have to write JSON by hand.

**In short**

**JSON is for machines.** <br>
**Hova is for humans.**


## Hova in a Build Pipeline

To Hova:
```hova
/world
    enemies.hova
    items.hova
    npcs.hova
```

After Build (Emiting as json):
```hova
/hovabuild
    enemies.json
    items.json
    npcs.json
```



## 🧠 Philosophy

Hova is NOT a programming language.
Hova does NOT execute logic.

**Hova is for describing worlds.**
Clean.
Expressive.
Deterministic.

Machines consume JSON.
Humans deserve Hova.

## 🛠️ Defining Game Enemies

### ❌ JSON (machine-friendly, human-hostile)

```json
{
  "Enemies": {
    "Slime": {
      "Damage": 15,
      "MaxLife": 50,
      "Drop": {
        "Gold": 5,
        "Chance": 0.8
      }
    },
    "KnightGuard": {
      "Damage": 23,
      "MaxLife": 200,
      "Drop": {
        "Gold": 25,
        "Chance": 0.3
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Problems:
- Deep nesting hides meaning
- No semantic distinction between entities and metadata
- Repetition grows silently
- Refactoring is painful
- Hard to read as a *world*

### ✅ Hova (human-first, structured)

```hova
anvil Enemies be

    atomic be
        atom emit : "json"
    end

    ore Slime be
        spark Damage int : 15
        spark MaxLife int : 50

        spark Drop block : be
            Gold int : 25
            Change float : 0.3
        end
    end

    ore KnightGuard be
        spark Damage int : 23
        spark MaxLife int : 200

        ore Drop be
            spark Gold int : 25
            spark Chance float : 0.3
        end
    end

end
```
Benefits:
- Clear intent and hierarchy
- Entities feel like entities, not objects
- Structure reads like a design document
- Easy to expand, refactor and reason about
- Exports clean JSON instantly

## 🧩 Core Concepts

| Hova     | Meaning                    |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| `anvil`  | world / root container     |
| `atomic` | metadata + output behavior |
| `ore`    | entity / object            |
| `spark`  | property                   |
| `temper` | contract / schema          |
| `seal`   | behavior descriptor        |
| `rune`   | reusable definition        |

Hova models structure.
Your engine executes meaning.

    atomic be
        atom emit : "json"
        atom creator : "dotxav"
    end

    ore Square be
        spark sides int : 4
    end

    ore Triangle be
        spark sides int : 3
    end
end
```

3️⃣ Run:

```
hova forge shapes.hova
```

Output appears in:

```
outHova/Json
```

## 🔥 Final Thought

Hova isn’t “just another data format”.

It’s:

* a **language for worlds**
* a **bridge between creativity and machines**
* something game dev tools don’t have yet
